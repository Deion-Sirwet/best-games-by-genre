				<h2>Welcome to Best Games by Genre!</h2>
				<p>
				Best Games By Genre is a website meant to offer information about some of the best games out there based on different genres. These games do not make the list based on critic scores or sales necessarily, but rather by scores and reviews from regular players who gave these games enough time to be played and experienced properly. We also offer a way for people to connect and discuss their experiences with these games. This website provides you with a way to search for new games that maybe you haven't heard of or if you're interested in a new genre, you can see what some of the top rated games are so you are likely to enjoy it. Currently, the reviews are only based off of the platform "Steam", which is where most games are bought and played on PC.
				</p>
				<h3>What Genres Are on This List?</h3>
				<p>
				Currently, the genres offered on this site are First-Person Shooter (FPS), Role Playing Game (RPG), Racing, Fighting, and Puzzle games. Each page has three of the top rated games in its genre. Each game has a description, pictures, a link to the trailer, and some reviews from players.
				</p>
				<h3>Future Plans For The Website?</h3>
				<p>
				As I'm sure you noticed, there is a "Connect" page. Not only is that page meant for people to connect and bond over games on and off the list, there's another reason for this page. I would like to collect reviews from people who visit the site and also collect their thoughts on games and genres that they think should be on the list. I would also like to integrate reviews from console players as well, not just from Steam/PC players. I plan to take the top rated games and genres and add them because that's what this site is all about; the people's top games!
